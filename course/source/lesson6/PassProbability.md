Pass probability
================

There is different alternative ways of measuring which player has control over which part of the pitch. Many of
these build on the probability a pass is successful.

### Overview of pitch control and passing models

Pitch control is the probability that a player could control the ball assuming it is at that location. William Spearman explains: 
- the principles behind pitch control models 
- how they can be used to investigate player positioning
- how to extend them to account for ball motion. 
- How to combine pitch control models with measures of expected threat (see lesson 7)
- defines 'off-ball scoring opportunity'
