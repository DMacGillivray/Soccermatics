Expected goals
==============

### What are expected goals

Expected goals are a statistical measure of chance quality. They can be thought of as
the probability that on a typcial day of football a particular shot from that 
location would result in a goal. They are based on measurements taken over many 
different shots in the same or similar leagues. A statistical model is then fit in order
to quantify this probability. 

The natural starting point for this question is logistic regression. 



### The ultimate guide

I created a video for Friends of Tracking where I go through the
history of expected goals, explain how they are used and how they work.
