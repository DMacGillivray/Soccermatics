Case study: value and context
=============================

At Twelve football, we use a method similar to the one implemented 
in [the Python code](../gallery/lesson4/plot_ActionBasedExpectedThreat),
in order to value both attacking and defensive play. 

The art of taking an expected threat approach is (I believe) using the basic idea of evaluating 
every action and then thinking about how we can use  it in different contexts. It is far
to common for companies offering expected threat like solutions to talk about an "AI model of football". 
They often try to imply that models based on machine learning are more
objective than human judgement, or that their algorithm offers a solution to overall scouting problems. 

Such claims are misleading. 

It isn't possible to scout a player using just a single number or output of an AI. For example, 
some "AI solutions" 
claim to allow you to transfer in a player in to your squad and tell you the increase of predicted points. This is 
nothing short of AI snakeoil. Detailed prediction is not possible from machine learning. The reason
for this is that machine learning models are really just a simplified representation of 
the underlying data. We can see this if we think about the stages we have gone through in creating
models. We have made a simplfiied assumption about the memorylessness in football and 
we have used that to help us measure the value of
a position on the pitch or of a pass. There is no context or insight from the output of the model. 
We need to create our own context or insight.

To get something out of these models, we need to work with the output of our models 
using human insight and judgement.**We do need machine learning models to assign values to actions
but context remains key to interpreting our results.** 

The examples below highlight how we combine value and context when evaluating players at Welve football.

### Attacking play






Below are just a few examples of this.
