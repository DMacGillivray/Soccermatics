Expected Threat - Position-based  
================================

The name expected threat (xT) was introduced by Karun Singh, who proposed it in the 
public sphere [in a blog post in 2018](https://karun.in/blog/expected-threat.html). 
This blog post also gives an excellent introduction on how 
to implement expected threat, based on position on the pitch.

In this video, I talk through the expected threat approach and look at Singh's blog post in detail.
