Expected Threat - Action-based
==============================

We now move away from a position-based approach and take an approach based on chains of possession. 
To do this, we first need to look at the idea of a possession chain: a sequence of events 
where the same team has unbroken control of the ball. We then use this possession chain as the 
building block for an expected threat based on actions within that chain.

The logic of focussing on actions in a chain instead of position comes from the fact that
football is a dynamic game: the threat then lies in how the ball is moved, 
rather than where the ball is. A pass does not just have value because of where the ball ends up, 
it also has value on how it shifts the defence. Cross-field balls, which don't move the ball 
forward, should still give positive value. A method which evaluates passses 
should also assign positive value to back passes, since they can be a step 
toward moving the ball forward later on. By looking at the actions within a chain, we can start 
to look at this context. We can also include qualifiers, 
such as whether it was a cross or a through ball. This prevents, for example, us 
overvaluing ‘hopeful’ crosses in to the box. 

Thats the overall philosophy. We now look at how to build this approach.
