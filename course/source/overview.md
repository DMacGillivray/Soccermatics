Mathematical Modelling of Football
The introductory session is Monday 29th of August 15:15 - 17:00. A Zoom link will be sent to course participants, which will be used for all the lectures. Please be there. Recording will be made available below.

Learning approach
This course is online only. It is taught to a mixture of Uppsala students and students from all over the world who are taking it as a free-standing course.

Learning will be conducted in a flipped classroom style. 

In weeks 1-7 of the course you will

Work through the relevant material from the course webpage (coming soon).
Participate in drop-in Zoom problem sessions on Wednesday (15-16 or 19-20)
Submit your work in 3 assessed exercises.
Peer review other students work.
Participate in online question sessions/presentations on Monday 15-17. 
At the start of each week, check the corresponding section of the course and plan your week from that. Each week you should plan to work 13-15 hours on this course. Roughly 5-6 hours watching video material and doing exercises on the webpage, 3 hours question sessions/tutorials/presentations and 5-6 hours work on the projects. 

Weeks 8 and 9 will focus only on project work and presentations.

Course outline
Before you start! Here is what you need to get started on the course. Please go through this before the course starts. The main thing is to download data we will use and have a Python programming environment. 

The following is a rough timetable for the lectures and hand-ins. The Monday session each week will be primarily a chance to ask questions about the week before or to present work. 

30th August - 5th September: Visualising football with event data.

6th September - 12th September: Expected goals and other statistical models.

9th September: Deadline for hand-in 1 (Individual)

13th September - 19th September : Evaluating players and the team.

20th September - 26th September : Simulating matches and betting models.

27th September - 3rd October : Advanced machine learning models.

1st  October: Deadline for hand-in 2 (Individual)

4th October - 10th October : Player movements on the pitch.

11th October - 17th October: Pitch control.

18th October - 21st October: Guest lectures/additional topics. 

24th October - 29th October: Presentation of group work 

29th October: Deadline for hand-in 3 (Group)

Assessment
The total points for the three assessments is 50. 10 points for assessment 1, 20 points for assessment 2 and 20 points for group assessment 3.

To pass the course (grade 3) requires 23 points, grade 4 requires 32 points, and grade 5 requires 42 points.

Groups
The groups are organised as Premier League football teams. Under People/Groups take the team you would like to analyse out of the big six (limited to ten slots) or take Premier League Team 1 or 2 to decide together which non-big 6 team (in the PL in 2018 when our data is from) you want to analyse.

These groups will help each other during the course and then do the group project together. 

There is also Slack group (Links to an external site.) which you should join to ask general questions. Aleksander will answer questions here and you are encouraged to help each other as much as possible.
