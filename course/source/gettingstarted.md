Getting Started
===============

We recommend you start working 
through this material before the 
course starts.

### Setting up

The first step to getting going with football data 
is setting up a Python environment and to get some data to work with.
This video explains the tools you will need and 
the data you should get your hands on for the 
first part of the course.

This uses a slightly older version of Spyder than I currently use. 

- Downloading [Anaconda](http://anaconda.com/)
- Which programs you need for running R and Python code
- Orientate yourself within Spyder for Python
- A "hello world" example.
- What to do if you are feeling stuck?
- Learn the art of "copy and paste" programming (using [FCPython](https://fcpython.com/))
- Downloading [Statsbomb data](https://github.com/statsbomb/open-data).
- Downloading [Wyscout data](Links to an external site.).

### Hear from some football data scientists

In April 2020, David interviewed four 
football data scientists (Pascal Bauer, 
Deutscher Fu√üball-Bund; Javier Fernandez, 
Barcelona; Suds Gopaladesikan, 
Benfica and Fran Peralta, Hammarby) 
about their role at their clubs and national 
teams.  
They talk about their routes in to working 
within clubs and what they do. 
This discussion offers a great starting 
point to finding out what you need to know 
about the profession of football data scientist.
