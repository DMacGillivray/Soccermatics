What You Will Learn
===================
The contents of this course


Prerequisits
============
When I teach this course at Uppsala University, we have prequisits of of a university
level course in statistics, linear algebra and calculus.

This course isn't the same as a normal maths course because the type of maths we will use varys alot. In the next chapter we start with probability and statistics. In some chapters we will use high school maths and sometimes even maths you learnt at primary school. Other chapters will be more advanced, using calculus and game theory.

There are a few reasons for this. Firstly, there are lots of great maths courses out there, so I don't want to just reproduce one of them. I use Khan academy and will often use this as a resource, if you want to learn an idea in more depth.

The second reason for this structure is that real world modelling is not like a maths class. When we model reality – be it a football match, the spread of disease or the movement of a bird flock – we don't start the process on page one of a textbook. Mathematical modelling, which this course is about, is more creative than that. For each problem we face, we need to use a different piece of mathematics  to the heart of the problem.



History
=======

This course developed from the Friends of Tracking Youtube channel.


Soccermatics
============

This course builds on and uses a number of examples from my book Soccermatics.
We will often return to the book for inspiration, like the opening paragraph below,

But we will also go further than the book. Indeed, the reason
I have created these pages is **to teach the maths behind Soccermatics**.
To give you the analytical skills you need to understand the beautiful game
and to create mathematical models.
