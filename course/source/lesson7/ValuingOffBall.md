### Combining Pitch Control and Expected Threat

In this video Laurie Shaw describes how you can value player actions by combining an expected threat style 
model with a pitch control to investigate the best passing options available to the player on 
the ball at any moment of a game. Laurie refers to Expected Threat as EPV here, but it is created using the same 
principles we adopted in [lesson 4](../lesson4/xTPos.md) for fitting position-based Expected Threat.
