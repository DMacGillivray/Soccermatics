# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# At first we have to open the data. To do this we use a parser SBopen available in mplsoccer. 
# Using method *event* and putting the id of the game as a parameter we load the data.
# Then, we filter the dataframe so that only passes  are left

parser = Sbopen()
df, related, freeze, tactics = parser.event(69301)
passes = df.loc[df['type_name'] == 'Pass'].loc[df['sub_type_name'] != 'Throw-in'].set_index('id')

# Making the pass map using iterative solution
# ----------------------------
# Draw the pitch, record that Statsbomb is the default value of Pitch class.
# We iterate through the entire dataset. We check if a pass was made by Lucy Bronze
# If so, we take the starting coordinates of a pass and plot a circle. Then we subtract the coordinates beginning of the pass 
# from the end of passes to draw arrows. In the end, we set the title

# Plotting multiple pass maps on one figure
# ----------------------------
# mplsoccer allows to draw multiple plots on one plot. Let's demonstrate how to do that by plotting passes by player from 
# England's team. To do so we first filter out players from England. We plot 16 pitches in 4 rows and columns. Then, for each
# player, on a separate axis, their pass map is plotted. As the last step we remove unnecessary pitches (during 2019 World Cup
# only 3, not 5, changes were allowed) and set the title.

#prepare the dataframe of passes by England that were no-throw ins
mask_england = (df.type_name == 'Pass') & (df.team_name == "England Women's") & (df.sub_type_name != "Throw-in")
df_passes = df.loc[mask_england, ['x', 'y', 'end_x', 'end_y', 'player_name']]
#get the list of all players who made a pass
names = df_passes['player_name'].unique()

#draw 4x4 pitches
pitch = Pitch(line_color='black', pad_top=20)
fig, axs = pitch.grid(ncols = 4, nrows = 4, grid_height=0.85, title_height=0.06, axis=False,
                     endnote_height=0.04, title_space=0.04, endnote_space=0.01)

#for each player
for name, ax in zip(names, axs['pitch'].flat[:len(names)]):
    #put player name over the plot
    ax.text(60, -10, name,
            ha='center', va='center', fontsize=14)
    #take only passes by this player
    player_df = df_passes.loc[df_passes["player_name"] == name]
