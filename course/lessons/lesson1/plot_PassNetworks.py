# Opening the dataset
# ----------------------------
# At first we have to open the data. To do this we use a parser SBopen available in mplsoccer. 
# Using method *event* and putting the id of the game as a parameter we load the data.
# Event data is stored in a dataframe *df*

parser = Sbopen()
df, related, freeze, tactics = parser.event(69301)

##############################################################################
# Preparing the data
# ----------------------------
# For passing networks we use only accurate successfull passes made by a team until the first substitution.
# We need information about pass start and end location as well as player who made and received the pass. 
# To make the vizualisation clearer, we will annotate the players using their surname. 
# Note that it works for English women side, since players' surnames  are single-barrelled. 
# If you decide to work with, for example Spanish names, some modifications will be needed. For example, Leo Messi's name in Statsbomb is Lionel Andr√©s Messi Cuccittini.
# The following code would result in Cuccittini causing some confusion.

#check for index of first sub
sub = df.loc[df["type_name"] == "Substitution"].loc[df["team_name"] == "England Women's"].iloc[0]["index"]
#make df with successfull passes by England until the first substitution
mask_england = (df.type_name == 'Pass') & (df.team_name == "England Women's") & (df.index < sub) & (df.outcome_name.isnull())
#taking necessary columns
df_pass = df.loc[mask_england, ['x', 'y', 'end_x', 'end_y', "player_name", "pass_recipient_name"]]
#adjusting that only the surname of a player is presented.
df_pass["player_name"] = df_pass["player_name"].apply(lambda x: str(x).split()[-1])
df_pass["pass_recipient_name"] = df_pass["pass_recipient_name"].apply(lambda x: str(x).split()[-1])

##############################################################################
# Calculating vertices size and location
# ----------------------------
# To calculate vertices size and location, at first, we will create an empty dataframe.
# For each player we calculate average location of passes their made and their receptions.
# Then, we calculate number of passes made by each player.
# As the last step, we calculate the marker size used to scatter different sized points.
#creating a dataframe of average location of pass and pass reception by each player 

scatter_df = pd.DataFrame()
for i, name in enumerate(df_pass["player_name"].unique()):
    passx = df_pass.loc[df_pass["player_name"] == name]["x"].to_numpy()
    recx = df_pass.loc[df_pass["pass_recipient_name"] == name]["end_x"].to_numpy()
    passy = df_pass.loc[df_pass["player_name"] == name]["y"].to_numpy()
    recy = df_pass.loc[df_pass["pass_recipient_name"] == name]["end_y"].to_numpy()
    scatter_df.at[i, "player_name"] = name
    #make sure that x and y location for each circle representing the player is the average of passes and receptions
    scatter_df.at[i, "x"] = np.mean(np.concatenate([passx, recx]))
    scatter_df.at[i, "y"] = np.mean(np.concatenate([passy, recy]))
    #calculate number of passes
    scatter_df.at[i, "no"] = df_pass.loc[df_pass["player_name"] == name].count().iloc[0]

#adjust the size of a circle so that the player who made more passes 
scatter_df['marker_size'] = (scatter_df['no'] / scatter_df['no'].max() * 1500)

##############################################################################
# Calculating edges width
# ----------------------------
# To calculate edge width we have to calculate number of passes between players
# We need to group the dataframe of passes by the combination of passer and recipient and count passes between them.
# As the last step, we set the treshold that on our diagram we want to include only combination of players that made more than 2 passes.
# You can try different tresholds and investigate how the passing network changes when you change it. 
# It is recommended that you use higher threshold for more ball dominant teams and lower for less ball dominant ones.

#counting passes between players
lines_df = df_pass.groupby(['player_name', 'pass_recipient_name']).x.count().reset_index()
lines_df.rename({'x':'pass_count'}, axis='columns', inplace=True)
#setting a treshold. You can try to investigate how it changes when you change it.
lines_df = lines_df[lines_df['pass_count']>2]

##############################################################################
# Plotting vertices
# ----------------------------
# At first we plot the pitch using mplsoccer module Pitch
# Then, we scatter the vertices using the *scatter_df* we created previously
# As the next step, we annotate player's surname         
        

#Drawing pitch
pitch = Pitch(line_color='grey')
fig, ax = pitch.grid(grid_height=0.9, title_height=0.06, axis=False,
                     endnote_height=0.04, title_space=0, endnote_space=0)
#Scatter the location on the pitch
pitch.scatter(scatter_df.x, scatter_df.y, s=scatter_df.marker_size, color='red', edgecolors='grey', linewidth=1, alpha=1, ax=ax["pitch"], zorder = 3)
#annotating player name

    pitch.annotate(row.player_name, xy=(row.x, row.y), c='black', va='center', ha='center', weight = "bold", size=16, ax=ax["pitch"], zorder = 4)

##############################################################################
# Plotting edges
# ----------------------------
# For each combination of players who made passes, we make a query to *scatter_df* to get the start and end of the line.
# Then we adjust the line width so that the more passes between players, the wider the line.
# As the next step, we plot the lines on the pitch. It is recommended that zorder of edges is lower than zorder of vertices.
# In the end, we make the title.
for i, row in lines_df.iterrows():
        player1 = row["player_name"]
        player2 = row['pass_recipient_name']
        #take the average location of players to plot a line between them 
        player1_x = scatter_df.loc[scatter_df["player_name"] == player1]['x'].iloc[0]
        player1_y = scatter_df.loc[scatter_df["player_name"] == player1]['y'].iloc[0]

        player2_y = scatter_df.loc[scatter_df["player_name"] == player2]['y'].iloc[0]
        num_passes = row["pass_count"]
        #adjust the line width so that the more passes, the wider the line
